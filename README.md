# OHMYTASK

This project is a total reconstruction of a project already done, in the previous project I used `JavaScript`, `PHP8`, `SASS` and `MySQL`.
The current project uses `REACT` on the Frontend, separate from a Backend made in `Node JS`. As for Database, it is a `MongoDB`.
The purpose of the project is to create a system that allows you to create projects and tasks, where you can add collaborators registered in the system to your project.
